# Welcome to Graph Async Swarm AI (GAS AI) 

Currently, I have not setup the system as a python package. To play with the tools, git clone this repo and install the `requirements.txt` file into an environment of your choosing (`Conda`, `VirtualEnv`). Here is a conda example:

```shell
conda create --name gasai
conda activate gasai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, export your OPENAI API Key to environment variables with 

On Mac: 
```shell 
EXPORT OPENAI_API_KEY=".."
```

On Windows:
```shell
setx OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
```

Then, you should be all set to test out this code! Each folder's code has a respective readme which can help you learn more about the project. Please feel free to contribute. 

To test the code, you can run any of the examples like `networking-team.py` or `documentation-team.py` with the activated environment
