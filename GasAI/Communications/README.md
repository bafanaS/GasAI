# Communications

The `Communications` directory contains modules that outline the network communication schema utilized across the system.

## Components

- `Schema.py`: Defines the `Schema` class, which constructs the graph structure representing a communication network using a directed graph model, facilitating various operations like adding nodes, paths, and processing messages asynchronously through the system.

- `__init__.py`: Allows the directory to be treated as a Python package so that its modules can be easily imported elsewhere in the project.

The `Schema` class enables the construction and management of the communication network by keeping track of nodes and their interconnections. It provides methods to add and remove nodes and communication paths, and it implements utilities for traversing and visualizing the network.
